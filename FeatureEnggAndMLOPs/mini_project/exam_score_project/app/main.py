"""
app/main.py

A minimal FastAPI application that loads the pipeline saved by the notebook
(models/exam_score_pipeline.joblib) and serves predictions over HTTP.

This is the "notebook -> real application" step: everything the pipeline learned during
training (imputation medians, scaler means, one-hot categories, PCA directions, which
features survived selection, and the model's coefficients) is already baked into that ONE
file. This app's only job is to load it once, validate incoming requests, and call
.predict() -- it contains ZERO feature engineering logic of its own, on purpose. That is
exactly what prevents "the API preprocesses data slightly differently than training did,"
one of the most common real causes of a model behaving worse in production than in testing.

Run locally with:
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

Then try:
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
